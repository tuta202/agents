# Python code to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series:

def calculate_series_terms(terms):
    result = 0
    for i in range(terms):
        term = (-1)**i / (2*i + 1)  # Alternating signs and odd denominators
        result += term
    return result

# Calculate the sum of the first 10,000 terms multiplied by 4
terms = 10000
series_sum = calculate_series_terms(terms)
final_result = 4 * series_sum
print(final_result)


# Output of the code:
3.1414926535900345
```

This code successfully calculates the first 10,000 terms of the series and multiplies the result by 4, yielding an approximation of Pi: `3.1414926535900345`.
