Social media does more harm than good because it amplifies misinformation at an unprecedented scale, harming public trust and decision-making. It fosters mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, especially among adolescents. The platforms are designed to be addictive, exploiting usersâ€™ attention for profit, often at the cost of their well-being. Additionally, social media fuels echo chambers and polarization, eroding constructive dialogue and healthy societal discourse. While it has benefits, the widespread harm it inflicts on mental health, truth, and social cohesion far outweighs the positive aspects.
