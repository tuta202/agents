After reviewing the arguments presented, I find the position that "Social media does more harm than good" to be more convincing based on the merits of the arguments provided.  

The side arguing for the motion effectively highlighted the tangible and widespread negative impacts of social media, such as the amplification of misinformation, mental health detriments including increased anxiety and depression, addiction driven by profit motives, and the fostering of echo chambers and societal polarization. These points touch on systemic issues that are difficult to address and have profound short-term and long-term effects on individuals and society as a whole. The argument underscores how these harms not only undermine public trust and well-being but also erode meaningful social discourse and cohesion, framing social media more as a net negative influence.  

In contrast, the opposing argument, while valid in emphasizing the benefits of social media in empowering marginalized voices, providing platforms for advocacy and education, and offering global connectivity, relies heavily on the assumption that responsible use and regulation can mitigate the harms. However, it does not sufficiently counter the claims about the platforms' design fostering harm or adequately address the argument that these harms are systemic and pervasive. While the positive potential of social media is evident, the opposing side underestimates the challenges of enforcing and maintaining responsible use and regulation on a global scale.  

Ultimately, while both sides provide important perspectives, the case that social media poses significant and systemic harm is more convincing due to its grounding in tangible and irrefutable impacts, as well as its acknowledgment of the difficulty in mitigating those harms. Therefore, the motion "Social media does more harm than good" stands as the more compelling argument.
